### **Description**

The app displays a list of the top 10 movies and provides a detail page for each selected movie. 

#### **Key Highlights:**
- **UI Design**: As the assignment did not provide specific UI requirements, I have designed the UI based on appâ€™s functionality.
- **SwiftUI**: The UI is completely built using SwiftUI.
- **MVVM**: The app follows the MVVM design pattern.
- **Concurrency**: Async/Await is used throughout the app to implement concurrency and manage asynchronous tasks.
- **Unit Tests**: Unit Tests have been added validating key functionalities.
- **Error Handling**: Network errors are handled appropriately with the UI updated accordingly.
- **Image Caching**: Images are cached to avoid making unnecessary network requests.
